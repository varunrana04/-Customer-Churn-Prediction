"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   All three trained models (Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier) achieved a perfect F1-score of 1.0 on the test set.
*   The perfect F1-scores were attributed to data leakage identified in the features `CustomerStatus`, `ChurnCategory`, and `ChurnReason`.
*   Analysis showed a perfect correlation between specific categories within `CustomerStatus`, `ChurnCategory`, and `ChurnReason` and the `ChurnLabel`. For example, when `CustomerStatus` was 0 or 1, `ChurnLabel` was always 1 (churn), and when `CustomerStatus` was 2, `ChurnLabel` was always 0 (no churn).
*   `SatisfactionScore` and `ChurnScore` also showed strong correlations with `ChurnLabel` ($-0.75$ and $0.66$ respectively), but the primary cause of perfect prediction was the leakage in the other three features.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Redo the model training after removing the identified data leakage features (`CustomerStatus`, `ChurnCategory`, `ChurnReason`) to build a model that generalizes better to unseen data.
*   Investigate the origin of the data leakage to prevent it in future data collection or preparation processes.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   All three classification models (Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier) achieved a perfect F1-score of 1.0, along with 100% accuracy, precision, and recall on the initial test set.
*   The initial perfect scores were attributed to data leakage identified through model coefficient analysis and further data analysis after removing leakage features. Features like `CustomerStatus`, `ChurnCategory`, and `ChurnReason` were found to be highly correlated with `ChurnLabel` and likely caused the leakage.
*   After removing the leakage features, a subsequent correlation analysis revealed that `ChurnScore`, `SatisfactionScore`, `Contract`, `TenureinMonths`, and `Number_of_Referrals` were among the features with the strongest correlations to `ChurnLabel`.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The initial model performance was misleading due to data leakage. Re-evaluate the models after removing the identified leakage features (`CustomerStatus`, `ChurnCategory`, `ChurnReason`) to obtain a more realistic assessment of their predictive capability.
*   Utilize the processed data without leakage features (exported as "churn\_data\_for\_tableau.csv") in Tableau to perform the intended visualizations (Churn rate by tenure, Monthly charges vs. churn status, Internet Service vs. Churn) and gain actionable business insights from the non-leaky data.
