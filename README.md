# -Customer-Churn-Prediction - 
This project successfully analyzed the "customer_churn_data.csv" dataset using Logistic Regression and other classification models to predict customer churn. Initial models showed perfect performance; however, detailed analysis revealed significant data leakage from features like CustomerStatus, ChurnCategory, and ChurnReason, which were removed to build a more realistic and generalizable model. After cleaning the data, relevant features such as ChurnScore, SatisfactionScore, TenureinMonths, and Contract were identified as key predictors of churn. The cleaned and processed data was exported to "churn_data_for_tableau.csv" for visualization. These Tableau visualizations — churn rate by tenure, monthly charges vs. churn status, and internet service vs. churn — will enable deeper business insights and support data-driven decision-making to reduce churn.
